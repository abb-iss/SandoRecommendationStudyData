Data Collection from Sando: Study of Recommendation Usage 
============================

We collected two data sets in order to answer the following research
questions:

* RQ1: How often do developers use Coronado’s recommendations during their normal work to improve their queries?
* RQ2: Do developers seem satisfied with queries constructed from Coronado’s recommendations?
* RQ3: Are Coronado’s recommendations more helpful to users that are not familiar with the source codebase?
